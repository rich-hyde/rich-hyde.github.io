				<p>The usual bass section not bothering to learn 
				their notes or practice at home and me singing the odd solo. 
				Also, the rest of the choir seemed to have the same issues this time.</p>
				<p>I wanted to do the beautiful 'O quam tristis' solo but was given the
				'fac me plagis' bass aria instead.</p>
				<p>We moved to the main hall with its better acoustics for some of the rehearsals but most
				held in the awful side hall.</p>
				<p>Music director got a little 'shirty' with the lack of preparation by the choir just
				before last rehearsal - and rightly so!</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.stjamesnewbradwell.org.uk/">St. James church</a> New Bradwell</p>
				<p>This went well. Choir sang well. The soloists were pretty average for the most part (except me of course! - and the audience thought so too, coming up to me afterward and praising my solo (thanks).</p>
				<p>The 'MK chorale players' effectively sight-reading, performed wonderfully.</p>
				<p>The organ concerto bit - Cuckoo and Nightingale - was just about a good as any performance I've heard on the radio!</p>
				<p>It felt really good being up front on my own with a whole orchestra accompanying my solo. 
				Making good music with a bunch of professionals is an experience I want to repeat.</p>
